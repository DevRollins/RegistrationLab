# RegistrationLab
Simulates a school's registration process

Data structures project using stacks, queues, and linked-lists 

TO USE SIMULATION:
First line of input should be an integer, let's call it x. X simulates how many laptops will be
available for use. The next x inputs should be unique serial numbers for the laptops 
After this, we input how many days, d, this simulation will run for. Then, we input how many students will arrive on this specific day, s. We will get s lines of is command:
 ENTERTIME - An integer representative of how many minutes past 12PM it is
 LASTNAME - Student's last name
 FIRSTNAME - Student's first name
 ID - Student's ID
 NUMCLASSES - Number of student's classes


This program does not function as well as I would like it too, but it was definitely a great learning experience for the utility of array-based stacks and linked-list based queues.
